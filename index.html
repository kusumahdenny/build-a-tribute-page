        <p>Led Zeppelin are one of the most innovative and influential bands of all time and their songs are known by rock fans all over the world. The English rockers, who were formed in 1969 by Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and the late John Bonham have sold an estimated 300 million records sold worldwide, with five of their albums even reaching diamond status.</p>
